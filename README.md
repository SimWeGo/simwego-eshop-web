3- run "npm install" in the terminal in order to install required dependencies listed in package.json file
4- run "npm run dev" in the terminal in order to start the project locally

**_Env Variables_**
Some variables require enhanced security and should be stored in a .env file.

//NAVBAR LOGO NAME
VITE_APP_PROJECT_TITLE=******

//Use the running environment to add conditional logic in Vite or other files based on it
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=******

**_LOGINS_**
in the project we have 3 types of login

- Temporary login that allows a user limited access solely to purchase a bundle, restricting access to other features.
- Standard login where the user enters their email and receives a one-time password (OTP) to log in.
- Social login with google and facebook

**_SOCIAL LOGINS_**
for social login we need accounts on firebase console, google console, facebook , supabase

--Firebase:--

- Authentication => signin Methods
  => Enable google and facebook as sign-in providers
  => when enabling facebook sign-in method add your facebook app id and secret and copy the callback link to be added in your facebook app config setting under facebook login

- Settings => Authorized domains
  => add all the authorized domains

--Google Console:--

-Clients => OAuth 2.0 client IDs  
=> when enabling signin-in methods in firebase a web client id will be automatically generated by google servive
=> save the client id to be added later on to google client ids list in supabase
=> edit the ids by adding authorized javascript origins and authorized redirect urls
authorized javascript origins is the exact domain link
authorized redirect urls is the detailed link
NB : you should notice the firebase link auto filled in authorized redirect urls

--Supabase:--

- Authentication => Signin/ UP
  => Add google as provider and add your client id (created by google service in google console) to the list of client ids seperated by comma
  => Add facebook as provider with your facebook app id and secret and copy the callback link to be added in your facebook appconfig setting under facebook login

- Authentication => URL Configuration
  => add allowed redirect URLS (facebook sign-in is using signinWithOAuth where a redirect url is used to redirect the user ,
  so we should add this link here to be accepted and redirect the user successfully)

--Facebook:--
https://developers.facebook.com/
my apps => Facebook Login => Settings
=> Add the valid OAuth redirect URLs — these should include the Firebase and Supabase callback URLs mentioned above.

**_NOTIICATIONS_**
for notifications we are using firebase integration

- firebase => project settings => general
  => create your web app and save the config to be added in your env variables

- firebase => project settings => cloud messaging => web configuration
  => generate a web push key pair to be added in your env variables

**_Payment_**
Stripe now is used for card payment
after choosing a bundle an api will be called to get the stripe client id and stripe promise in order to display the payment element
